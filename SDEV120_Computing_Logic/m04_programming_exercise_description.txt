Program description:

Create a Python program to calculate an apartment complex rental agent's commission. The program accepts the ID number and name of the agent who rented the apartment, and the number of bedrooms in the apartment. The commission is $100 for renting a three-bedroom apartment, $75 for renting a two-bedroom apartment, $55 for renting a one-bedroom apartment, and $30 for renting a studio (zero-bedroom) apartment. Output is the salespersonâ€™s name and ID number and the commission earned on the rental.

Please take note of the divider in the program output - it's a string of 20 underscores. You will need to put this in your program output. You can copy and paste it from the program description.
