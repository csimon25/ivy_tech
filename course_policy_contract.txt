By typing my name in the textbox, I am confirming that I have read the syllabus and understand the course policies. These include the following:


COURSE POLICY CONTRACT

I understand that class participation is an integral part of this course.

I understand that lectures are not recorded, and will not be recorded on request. It is my responsibility to obtain missed information; I may do so by asking another student or attending instructor office hours.

I understand that any assignments (labs or exams) that are set to be due at the end of class must be completed within the time period of that class. Failure to do so will result in a zero grade for the assignment. If I am not able to complete the assignment in the given time, I may request an extension of the due date from my instructor at the end of class time.

I understand that I may miss up to two classes without penalty for late work provided that I inform the instructor ahead of time of my absense, and that after two missed labs no credit will be given for any work missed during class time. I understand that I do not need to include detailed reasons for absense except in the case of extended absense - a simple notification


REMOTE STUDENT ADDENDUM

I understand that the same social expectations that apply to in-person students also apply to remote learners.

I understand that turning video off or not having video for will result in my removal from the current meeting.

I understand that there will be breaks during the class, during which I can take care of personal needs. If I need to leave the class meeting (not be in front of the camera) I will return within a reasonable amount of time.


ETHICS ADDENDUM

I understand that my thoughts and ideas are valuable, and that I can choose to use them to make a positive contribution to a larger shared society.

I understand that my instructor is an imperfect human being who values my education, but may (and probably will) make many mistakes over the course of the class. I may offer feedback to the instructor about anything that might be done more effectively, and this will in no way have an impact on my grade for this course.
